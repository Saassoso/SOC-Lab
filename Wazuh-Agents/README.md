# Wazuh Agents Installation - General Overview

## Overview

This document covers the installation of 4 Wazuh agents on different platforms: Windows 11, Kali Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). These agents will communicate with the Wazuh Manager server at IP address **192.168.88.130**.

Each agent will be assigned a unique name and group for better management and will be installed using the appropriate Wazuh agent package and installation commands.

**Wazuh agent enrollment** is the process of registering a Wazuh agent to a Wazuh manager. This enrollment allows the Wazuh agents to communicate securely with the Wazuh manager and become authorized members of the Wazuh security platform.
